# Product Context: JSPX Web Framework

## Problem Statement
Java web development has traditionally been complex and verbose, requiring developers to manage separate concerns like:
- Request handling and routing
- Page composition and templating
- Component lifecycle management
- AJAX interactions and postback handling
- Data binding between UI and business objects
- Validation across client and server sides

Existing Java web frameworks often require steep learning curves and extensive configuration.

## Solution Approach
JSPX provides a component-based web framework that:
- **Simplifies Web Development**: Declarative XML-based page definition similar to ASP.NET Web Forms
- **Reduces Boilerplate**: Built-in components handle common web patterns (forms, data grids, validation)
- **Manages State**: Automatic view state management and postback handling
- **Supports Modern UI**: Integrated Bootstrap/jQuery support with AJAX capabilities
- **Enables Reusability**: Master pages and user controls promote code reuse

## Target Users
- **Java Web Developers**: Building enterprise web applications
- **Teams Migrating from ASP.NET**: Familiar page/control model
- **Rapid Prototypers**: Need quick web application development
- **Enterprise Projects**: Requiring robust, maintainable web solutions

## Key User Workflows

### Page Development
1. Define page structure in XML (JSPX file)
2. Create controller class extending Page/ContentPage/MasterPage
3. Use annotations for data binding (@JspxBean, @JspxWebControl)
4. Implement event handlers for user interactions
5. Framework handles rendering and state management

### Component Usage
1. Drag-and-drop approach with built-in controls
2. Set properties declaratively in XML
3. Bind data using expression language (JEXL)
4. Apply validation rules
5. Handle events in code-behind

### AJAX Integration
1. Wrap content in AjaxPanel controls
2. Framework automatically handles partial page updates
3. Client-side scripts generated automatically
4. Server-side event model remains consistent

## Value Proposition
- **Faster Development**: Pre-built components and patterns
- **Maintainable Code**: Clear separation of markup and logic
- **Rich Interactions**: Built-in AJAX without complex JavaScript
- **Enterprise Ready**: Security, internationalization, and scalability features
- **Familiar Model**: Similar to popular web frameworks but Java-native

## Success Metrics
- Reduced development time for common web scenarios
- Higher developer productivity through component reuse
- Maintainable applications with clear architectural patterns
- Successful deployment in production environments
- Positive developer experience and adoption
